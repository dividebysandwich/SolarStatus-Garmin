# SolarStatus-Garmin
A solar status display for the Garmin Epix that can display the status of your PV energy system, home energy storage, etc.
This includes a glance that alternates between the following data histograms:
PV output, current power consumption, power coming from/to the grid, power coming from/to the battery, and battery state of charge (SOC).

To use, you need to have a REST endpoint somewhere that can provide a JSON structure that fits this example message:
